# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Support Vector Machine and Convolutional Neural Network Techniques

The aim of the project was to study the digit recognition problem using state-of-the-art AI techniques. We performed detailed research to understand different ML classifiers applicable for the pattern recognition problem. The main classifiers considered are KNN, HMM, SVM, neural networks. We decided to go for SVM classifier as it showed higher recognition rates for pattern recognition problems in the past. However, we mainly applied deep neural network - CNN to solve digit recognition problem. Comparisons were made for different designed models. While SVM models achieved highest accuracy of 94.77%, CNN model performed much better on the MNIST dataset with overall 99.12% accuracy.
